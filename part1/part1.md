Q1. It writes the value ***i*** to log on the debugging console.\
Q2. It writes the value ***discountedPrice*** to log on the debugging console.\
Q3. It writes the value ***finalPrice*** to log on the debugging console.\
Q4. It will return the discounted list [ 50, 100, 150 ], since the input for prices is a list and the discount is 0.5, so the soltuion will a list with 0.5 discount.\
Q5. It will have ReferenceError since ***i*** is undefine\
Q6. It will have ReferenceError since ***discountedPrice*** is undefine\
Q7. It writes the value ***finalPrice*** to log on the debugging console.\
Q8. It will return the discounted list [ 50, 100, 150 ], since the input for prices is a list and the discount is 0.5, so the soltuion will a list with 0.5 discount.\
Q9. It will have TypeError becuase ***i*** is constant\
Q10. It will have TypeError becuase ***discountedPrice*** is constant\
Q11. It will have TypeError becuase ***finalPrice*** is constant\
Q12. Can't return because of these errors\
Q13. \
&emsp;&emsp; A. console.log(**student.name**);\
&emsp;&emsp; B. console.log(**student['Grad Year']**);\
&emsp;&emsp; C. console.log(**student.greeting()**);\
&emsp;&emsp; D. console.log(**student['Favorite Teacher'].name**);\
&emsp;&emsp; E. console.log(**student.courseLoad[0]**);\
Q14. \
&emsp;&emsp; A. **'32'** when adding char/string and int, JavaScript will treat the number as a char/string.\
&emsp;&emsp; B. **1** char '3' be treated as int and 3-2 = 1 \
&emsp;&emsp; C. **3** when adding int and falsy value, falsy value be treated as 0\
&emsp;&emsp; D. **3null** when adding char and falsy value, falsy value be treated as string\
&emsp;&emsp; E. **4** when adding bool and int, JavaScript will treat the bool as a int 1 or 0.\
&emsp;&emsp; F. **0** when adding bool and int, JavaScript will treat the bool as a int 1 or 0.\
&emsp;&emsp; G. **3undefined** when adding string and falsy value, falsy value be treated as string\
&emsp;&emsp; H. **NaN**\
Q15. \
&emsp;&emsp; A. **True** When comparing a string with a number, JavaScript will convert the string to a number when doing the comparison. \
&emsp;&emsp; B. **False** When comparing two strings, "2" will be greater than "12", because (alphabetically) 1 is less than 2.\
&emsp;&emsp; C. **True** Using double equals == in JavaScript, two values are compared only after attempting to convert them into a common type.\
&emsp;&emsp; D. **False** When using triple equals === in JavaScript, both the type and the value we are comparing have to be the same to be true.\
&emsp;&emsp; E. **False** For boolean values, true becomes 1, so 1 == 2 is false\
&emsp;&emsp; F. **True** Boolean(2) return true, so true === true is true\
Q16. When using triple equals === in JavaScript, we are testing for strict equality. This means both the type and the value we are comparing have to be the same. When using double equals == in JavaScript, two values are compared only after attempting to convert them into a common type.\
Q17. It will print 'How are you?' because 2 is != true so go to line 3, the else if condition is true so it prints 'How are you?'\
Q19. When the function get called, in the for-loop, newArr is push in a (1, doSomething(1, callback)), and then doSomething(1, callback) will return 1+2 whcih is 3, then callback return 3\*2 which is 6 and got push into the newArr and i increase. same way to get 8 and 10. \
Q21. The output is **1,4,3,2**.
